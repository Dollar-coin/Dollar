## Introduction

We live in a world that evolves day after day with a massive speed of technology around us, in 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto published a 9 page white-paper describing Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency that would change the whole world financial payments system including cash and credit cards. 10 years later, he proved that, indeed, bitcoin became first cryptocurrency that dominates without any control by any financial entity.

## What Is a Cryptocurrency?

A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.
The word "Crypto" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.

#### KEY TAKEAWAYS
+ A cryptocurrency is a new form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers. This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control of governments and central authorities.
+ The word “cryptocurrency” is derived from the encryption techniques which are used to secure the network.
+ Blockchains, which are organizational methods for ensuring the integrity of transactional data, is an essential component of many cryptocurrencies.
+ Many experts believe that blockchain and related technology will disrupt many industries, including finance and law. 
+ Cryptocurrencies face criticism for a number of reasons, including their use for illegal activities, exchange rate volatility, and vulnerabilities of the infrastructure underlying them. However, they also have been praised for their portability, divisibility, inflation resistance, and transparency. 

## What is a Blockchain?

Blockchain seems complicated, and it definitely can be, but its core concept is really quite simple. A blockchain is a type of database. To be able to understand blockchain, it helps to first understand what a database actually is. 

A database is a collection of information that is stored electronically on a computer system. Information, or data, in databases is typically structured in table format to allow for easier searching and filtering for specific information. What is the difference between someone using a spreadsheet to store information rather than a database?

Spreadsheets are designed for one person, or a small group of people, to store and access limited amounts of information. In contrast, a database is designed to house significantly larger amounts of information that can be accessed, filtered, and manipulated quickly and easily by any number of users at once.

Large databases achieve this by housing data on servers that are made of powerful computers. These servers can sometimes be built using hundreds or thousands of computers in order to have the computational power and storage capacity necessary for many users to access the database simultaneously. While a spreadsheet or database may be accessible to any number of people, it is often owned by a business and managed by an appointed individual that has complete control over how it works and the data within it.

So how does a blockchain differ from a database?

## Storage Structure

One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is the way the data is structured. A blockchain collects information together in groups, also known as blocks, that hold sets of information. Blocks have certain storage capacities and, when filled, are chained onto the previously filled block, forming a chain of data known as the “blockchain.” All new information that follows that freshly added block is compiled into a newly formed block that will then also be added to the chain once filled.

A database structures its data into tables whereas a blockchain, like its name implies, structures its data into chunks (blocks) that are chained together. This makes it so that all blockchains are databases but not all databases are blockchains. This system also inherently makes an irreversible timeline of data when implemented in a decentralized nature. When a block is filled it is set in stone and becomes a part of this timeline. Each block in the chain is given an exact timestamp when it is added to the chain.

## Decentralization

For the purpose of understanding blockchain, it is instructive to view it in the context of how it has been implemented by Bitcoin. Like a database, Bitcoin needs a collection of computers to store its blockchain. For Bitcoin, this blockchain is just a specific type of database that stores every Bitcoin transaction ever made. In Bitcoin’s case, and unlike most databases, these computers are not all under one roof, and each computer or group of computers is operated by a unique individual or group of individuals.  

Imagine that a company owns a server comprised of 10,000 computers with a database holding all of its client's account information. This company has a warehouse containing all of these computers under one roof and has full control of each of these computers and all the information contained within them. Similarly, Bitcoin consists of thousands of computers, but each computer or group of computers that hold its blockchain is in a different geographic location and they are all operated by separate individuals or groups of people. These computers that makeup Bitcoin’s network are called nodes. 

In this model, Bitcoin’s blockchain is used in a decentralized way. However, private, centralized blockchains, where the computers that make up its network are owned and operated by a single entity, do exist. 

In a blockchain, each node has a full record of the data that has been stored on the blockchain since its inception. For Bitcoin, the data is the entire history of all Bitcoin transactions. If one node has an error in its data it can use the thousands of other nodes as a reference point to correct itself. This way, no one node within the network can alter information held within it. Because of this, the history of transactions in each block that make up Bitcoin’s blockchain is irreversible. 

If one user tampers with Bitcoin’s record of transactions, all other nodes would cross-reference each other and easily pinpoint the node with the incorrect information. This system helps to establish an exact and transparent order of events. For Bitcoin, this information is a list of transactions, but it also is possible for a blockchain to hold a variety of information like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company’s product inventory. 

In order to change how that system works, or the information stored within it, a majority of the decentralized network’s computing power would need to agree on said changes. This ensures that whatever changes do occur are in the best interests of the majority.

# Dollar Cryptocurrency

## Introduction

Dollar (symbol: $) is the name of more than 20 currencies. They include Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, New Zealand dollar, Singapore dollar, New Taiwan dollar, Jamaican dollar, Liberian dollar, Namibian dollar, Brunei dollar, the United States dollar and several others.
On 15 January 1520, the Kingdom of Bohemia began minting coins from silver mined locally in Joachimsthal and marked on reverse with the Bohemian lion. The coins would be named joachimsthaler after the town, becoming shortened in common usage to thaler or taler. The town itself derived its name from Saint Joachim, whereby the German word Thal (Tal in modern spelling) means 'valley' (cf. the English term dale).

This name found its way into other languages, for example:

German — Thaler (or Taler)
Czech and Slovak — tolar
Low German — daler
Dutch — rijksdaalder (or daler),
Danish and Norwegian — rigsdaler
Swedish — riksdaler
Spanish - Spanish dólar (real de a ocho or Peso duro)
Ethiopian — talari (ታላሪ )
English — dollar

The term "dollar" has also been adopted by other countries for currencies which do not share a common history with other dollars. Many of these currencies adopted the name after moving from a £sd-based to a decimalized monetary system. Examples include the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, the Jamaican dollar, the Cayman Islands dollar, the Fiji dollar, the Namibian dollar, the Rhodesian dollar, the Zimbabwe dollar, and the Solomon Islands dollar.

The tala is based on the Samoan pronunciation of the word "dollar".
The Slovenian tolar had the same etymological origin as dollar (that is, thaler).

## Why Dollar cryptocurrency was created?

Every day, many altcoins are created, some have value and some are created without purpose and maybe are experimental.
Dollar cryptocurrency was created in order to unify the Dollar as a basic currency, if you explain bitcoin, Ethereum and all the other cryptocurrencies in existence to anyone, they would simply get confused. The term Dollar is a common word. The big issue with it is when the Federal Reserve keep printing non-stop causing inflation and weaken the dollar itself in a whole.

People believe in Dollar as a world known currency, it enforces its power from its value, common example is the United States Dollar, but the issue here is that no one would know if the US Dollar would keep its value forever.
Dollar Cryptocurrency has a limited number of coins which was set to 73400000 coins, no more and no less, at least you would know how many coins are in existence.
The main goal of the Dollar cryptocurrency is to keep +50% of its value in comparison with the actual physical US Dollar. Example: 1 DOLLAR = 2 USD.
DOLLAR Cryptocurrency is based on 256-SHA bitcoin encryption Proof-of-Work algorithm, a block is generated every 5 minutes, block halving would occur every 510000 blocks. A miner would get 70 DOLLAR as a reward which can be spent after 71 confirmations.
